= Concepts

This section explains some basic concepts of Doppelgaenger.

NOTE: In the following sections YAML is being used to represent data. However, this is just to make it more readable.
Internally, JSON is used as a representation.

== Entities

Application:: A group of resources which belong together, isolating it from others.

Thing:: A "digital" (or virtual) thing, which is being represented by Doppelgaenger.It is part of exactly one
application.This doesn't necessarily map to a device directly, but maybe to some part of the device.
+
While there exist no hard references between things, it is possible to use soft references (pointers) which reference
other things.With this, it is possible to establish relationships (like parent/child, groups, â€¦) between things.

Properties:: "Properties", or "Features" of a thing.Each thing can have any number of properties.

== The anatomy of a thing

A thing consists of:

ID:: A unique identifier for a thing.The ID is unique as part of an application.The combination of application ID
and thing ID makes it unique in a Doppelgaenger instance.

Metadata:: Additional metadata, similar to the Kubernetes metadata structure.But not guaranteed to follow the same
semantics.

Reported properties:: These are properties which are reported from an external system.The intention is, that these
are the values/measurements taken by devices, and reported to the higher level systems (like Doppelgaenger).
+
Reported properties have a name, a "last updated" timestamp, and a value.

Synthetic properties:: These are properties which are "artificially" generated, mainly based on reported properties.
+
Synthetics properties, same as the reported properties, have a name, a "last updated" timestamp, and a value.
Additionally, they also have a configured logic, describing the logic generating the value.
+
Simple use-cases are: renaming of properties (e.g. `bat` => `battery`), extracting values from other properties (`{"battery": {"level": 1.23}}` => `{"batteryLevel": 1.23}`), transforming values (e.g. convert degree Fahrenheit to
Celsius).

Desired properties:: These are properties which declare a desired state of a reported or synthetic property. This is
intended for synchronizing a state back to the device, reporting the values.
+
Synthetics properties, same as the reported properties, have a name, a "last updated" timestamp, and a value.
Additionally, they also have a configured method of reconciling the desired vs actual state.
+
The intention is to generate commands, which are sent back to the device feeding the thing state, triggering a state
change.

Schema:: A thing can have an optional JSON schema attached. A schema will ensure that any mutation of the thing will
either validate against the schema, or fail the operation.

Reconciliation:: Certain events on the thing can trigger additional actions. These actions are intended to
be custom code, provided by the user. Currently, the following events are available: state change, request to delete,
timer expired.

== Properties

As mentioned in <<the_anatomy_of_a_thing>>, there are three types of properties: reported, synthetic, and desired.

What they have in common is: a name, a "last updated" timestamp, and a value.

=== Name

The name of a property is unique, but not across property this. Meaning: a thing can have a property named
`temperature` in the reported, synthetic, and desired map.

This is simple in the case of the desired property, as it declares the state this property "should have". So it
"amends" the reported/synthetic value.

However, for the reported and synthetic state, there might be an overlap. This is intentional, and allows the consuming
application to chose which value it evaluates. By default, the rule should be to use the synthetic value over the
reported value. Still, in same cases it is important to have the original value available.

=== Last updated

[NOTE]
====
This is actually badly named at the moment. Timestamps are like good naming, difficult.

Right name, the name is "last updated", but indeed it is "last time the value changed", and "changed" meaning it
differed from the previous value. And update to the same value, would not change the timestamp.

This is because only changes in the thing state are considered a change. And so, the property is not considered updated.

Maybe this will change in the future, into something like: last reported and last changed. But this needs more
consideration.
====

=== Value

This can be any JSON value. It can be a scalar JSON value (like a boolean, or a string), or it can be an array or object.
It can also be `null`.

The thing schema can be used to enforce what the value should look like.

== State & Reconciliation

Any change to the thing (reported state or configuration) works as follows:

* Load the current state
* Apply the change
* Run the required reconciliation
* If the thing changed{empty}footnote:[A custom code snipping sending an event is a change too], persist the new state, and send events

== Outgoing events

Things can send out events to other things during reconciliation. This allows things to initiate changes on other
things, based on its own state.

For example, this can be used to evaluate a level threshold of a value, and based on this, add/remove itself from the
list of references of another thing. Creating a group of things violating a threshold condition.

== Keeping it simple

A key goal of Doppelgaenger is, to rely on basic building blocks. Allowing higher level features being created on top
of this. This section will give a few examples what is mean by this.

The idea is to reduce complexity in the code base, by not creating highly specialized functionalities. And offer
more flexibility by not being too opinionated. However, not being opinionated, doesn't mean we do don't provide
such functionality. It just isn't an atomic feature in the code base.

=== Soft references

There are no relationships between things, other than the fact that things belong to a single application
(has-a/composition relationship).

However, as things do have an identifier, it is of course possible to create a reference to another thing.

=== Parent/Child relationship

A pattern used by the project is for example to declare a parent/child relationship between things using soft
references:

[source,yaml]
----
---
metadata:
  name: thing1 # <1>
  application: app1
reportedState:
  "$children":
    value:
      "thing1/component1": {} # <2>
      "thing1/component2": {} # <2>
---
metadata:
  name: thing1/component1
  application: app1
reportedState:
  "$parent":
    value: "thing1" # <3>
---
metadata:
  name: thing1/component2
  application: app1
reportedState:
  "$parent":
    value: "thing1" # <3>
----
<1> ID of thing parent thing
<2> Child references
<3> Back-references to parent

The convention used is simple. A parent lists its children under a `$children` property. While children lists its
parent under a `$parent` property.

The `$parent` property uses a `string` type value, as it may only have one parent. While the `$children` property uses
a map of empty objects, implementing a "set" type for faster processing and uniqueness of entries.

=== Complex model tree

As the parent/child approach can be stacked multiple times, it is actually possible to create a complete tree of things.

This can also be used to provide a structure for other technologies, which rely on a structure like this. A
Doppelgaenger configuration like this, can easily be translated into an OPC UA data model. Exposing things and
properties through different kind of OPC UA nodes.

=== Grouping of things

The parent/child example was using a bidirectional approach to create a tree. Sometimes however, it is enough to just
have a forward reference.

Assuming the goal is to have a list of things which violate a certain condition, like a temperature threshold. This can
be done:

* Defining a synthetic value to evaluate the condition (actual thing)
* Creating a thing to list all things violating the condition (group thing)
* When the thing violates the condition, send an event to the group thing, listing itself
* When the thing stops violating the condition, send an event to remove itself from the group thing

This may look something like this:

NOTE: This is a highly simplified example to illustrate the use case.

[source,yaml]

metadata:
  name: warnings/temperature # <1>
  application: app1
reportedState:
  $things:
    value:
      "thing1/component1": {} # <2>
---

  name: thing1/component1 # <2>
  application: app1

    value: 120

  temperatureWarning:
    value: true # <3>

        context.newState.reportedState?.["temperature"]?.value > 100
reconciliation:
  changed:
    temperatureWarning:
      code: # <5>
        javaScript: |
          whenValueChanged("temperatureWarning", (value) => {
            const $ref = context.newState.metadata.name;
            const group = "warnings/temperature";
            if (value) {
              // add
              sendMerge(group, {reportedState: {"$refs": { value: { [$ref]: {} }}}});
            } else {
              // set to null -> remove
              sendMerge(group, {reportedState: {"$refs": { value: { [$ref]: null }}}});
            }
          })
----
<1> ID of the group thing
<2> ID of the actual thing
<3> State of the condition
<4> Code to evaluate the condition
<5> Code the register/unregister the actual thing with the group thing
