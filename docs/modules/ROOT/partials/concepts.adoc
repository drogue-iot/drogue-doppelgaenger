== Concepts

Some concepts used in this documentation are:

Application:: A group of resources which belong together, isolating it from others.

Thing:: A "digital" (or virtual) thing, which is being represented by Doppelgaenger. It is part of exactly one
application. This doesn't necessarily map to a device directly, but maybe to some part of the device.
+
While there exist no hard references between things, it is possible to use soft references (pointers) which reference
other things. With this, it is possible to establish relationships (like parent/child, groups, â€¦) between things.
