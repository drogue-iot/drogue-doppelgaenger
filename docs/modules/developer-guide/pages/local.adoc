= Local developer setup

A local developer setup can easily be set up. Just ensure that you installed the xref:pre-reqs.adoc[].

== Start the required services

You can start Kafka, Keycloak, and PostgreSQL in a local developer mode using:

[source,shell]
----
podman-compose -f develop/compose.yaml up
----

You will need to provide a configuration. Currently, the easiest way is to create a `.env` file in the `server`
directory before starting the process. The following file is an example, which should work out of the box:

[source,shell]
----
include::../attachments/dotenv[]
----
<1> Uncomment to enable tracing with Jaeger

And then run the local server binary:

[source,shell]
----
cd server
cargo run
----
